/**
In an unusual democracy, everyone is not equal. The vote count is a
function of worth of the voter. Though everyone is voting for each other.
As example, if A with a worth of 5 and B with a worth of 1 are voting
for C, the vote count of C would be 6.
You are given a list of people with their value of vote. You are also given
another list describing who voted for who all.
